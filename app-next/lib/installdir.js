// lib/installdir.js
// Safety rails around a world's install folder.
//
// Deleting a world with "also delete files" runs rm -rf on install_dir, so a bad
// value there is unrecoverable data loss. Nothing used to stop one world's folder
// from sitting *above* another's: pick "H:\PalworldServers" as the install folder
// for a second server and SteamCMD installs straight into the folder that already
// holds the first one. Deleting that world then took its sibling with it (issue #9).
//
// Two layers guard against it — refuse the overlapping folder at create time, and
// refuse the delete itself if a world somehow already points at one. The checks are
// deliberately conservative: when a folder isn't clearly a self-contained Palworld
// install, we decline and let the user remove it by hand.
